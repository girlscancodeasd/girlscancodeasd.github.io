<li>Thank you to everyone who responded to our form! If our math is correct, we will be reading the Ready Player 1 series 🎉!</li>
<li>You can find this book in the school library. Or, buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.ae/s?k=ready+player+one+book&crid=2CQJ1B4V7736X&sprefix=ready+player+one%2Caps%2C286&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_16">Amazon,</a> <a href="https://www.noon.com/uae-en/search/?q=ready%20player%20one">Noon,</a> or <a href="https://uae.kinokuniya.com/products?utf8=%E2%9C%93&is_searching=true&restrictBy%5Bavailable_only%5D=1&keywords=ready+player+one&taxon=&x=0&y=0">Kinokuniya.com</a> 📦 (or you could just go to Kinokuniya 🤣)!
<li>Or you can find it on your Kindle 📱📚!
<li> According to the responses we received, people would like to meet on Wednesday and Thursday └[∵┌]└[ ∵ ]┘[┐∵]┘! I will ask Mr. Roach on Sunday if we can book a slot in the library on those days during recess 😆!
<li> According to Mr. Roach we will not be able to meet during recess for now 😞.
<li> So, we will just have to wait and see if the Covid regulations ease up over time (hopefully in a couple of weeks) 😭.
<li> Good news 🧁!! We are going to have our first book club meeting on Wednesday 🎆!!
<li> On Wednesday please go to the library after you put your bags in your advisory (but please bring Ready Player 1 📚) 😄!
<li> Buuuuutt, if you do not have your book already, stop by the library (Mr. Roach told me that he found extra copies of the book) ✨📚✨!!
<li> If you get to the library before me please go to room #1 (or if a teacher who works in the library is there tell them that you are part of the book club) ✨📖✨!
<li> I am so excited to see you all next week 🎊!!
